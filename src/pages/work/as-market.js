					<p className="mt-5">
						A&S Market is a specialized grocery shop serving a large number of Romanian expats in the United
						Kingdom. Having found success offline, moving online was a no-brainer and proved to be highly
						successful, with the launch having a significant impact in the area, especially during the
						Coronavirus lockdowns.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-5">
						Our main goal for this project is to create a web presence for the well-established local shop,
						develop new routes to existing customers and reach new ones in the process.

						Result and Impact
					</Title>
					<p className="mt-5">
						We worked on new landing pages to showcase national delivery, custom coded with new sections
						that are customisable by the client directly from the Shopify Customiser. In addition, the
						sections are modular, meaning they’re reusable on any other page on the website.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-5">
						As A&S Market wants to showcase some of the benefits of shopping with them, we added incentive
						sections to the product page to explain how products are packed and shipped. This is very
						important to them as most products are fragile, and some need to be transported in special
						cooling containers. An estimated delivery time based on the buyer’s location has also been added
						to the product page, as customers are more likely to purchase with a due date in mind.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-5">
						A critical component all grocery stores need to have is excellent searching. By installing and
						configuring the Product Filter and Search Bar app, we managed to reduce the number of searches
						that led to no results to a minimum.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-5">
						Speaking of important website components, an essential feature is also good filtering. By
						creating custom filters based on tags, the user’s experience has been enhanced both on mobile
						and desktop. As a result, we have seen an increase of 67% in customers using filters after
						they’ve been optimized.
					</p>
					<p className="mt-5">
						We also act as virtual assistants, so we manage product imports and exports, website
						translations, copywriting both in Romanian and English, email marketing campaigns and custom
						design for various graphic materials.
