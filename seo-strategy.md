# **Complete SEO Strategy for Vevol Media - AI Agent Implementation Guide**

## **AI Agent Instructions for Content Generation**

### **Voice \& Tone Guidelines**

-   Use a **conversational, approachable tone** that's professional but not overly formal!!
-   **Write like you're talking to a friend who runs an ecommerce business**
-   Avoid corporate jargon and buzzwords like "synergistic solutions" or "cutting-edge"
-   **DO NOT invent performance data, statistics, or client metrics**
-   Position Vevol Media as the **technical bridge** between ecommerce owners and other specialized agencies.
-   Use inclusive language that speaks to both small startups and growing enterprises
-   Avoid these words: „expertiză”, „consultație”
-   When generating copy (text) for certain pages, avoid using the same word too many times on a page so it doesn't feel forced. Especially in headings/titles
-   For Romanian, do not use words like "dumneavoastră". Example: "afacerea dumneavoastră" should be "afacerea ta
-   Also, do not overuse the word "coordonare"/"coordonăm"/
-   For CTAs let's use wording that suggest that we're busy; for example: "Check availability"/"Verifică disponibilitatea". We do not work with everyone, we filter our clients thoroughly;
-   Avoid using "Să coordonăm ...." in headings/ctas

### **Positioning Strategy**

Vevol Media is the **central hub** that coordinates between ecommerce businesses and their ecosystem of service providers. We're the ones who:

-   Speak both technical and business language fluently
-   Proactively manage communication between you and your SEO, CRO, marketing, ERP, and financial service providers
-   Handle the technical implementation while others handle their specialties
-   Keep everything moving forward so nothing falls through the cracks
-   The Vevol team are **Shopify Developers** primarily but also offers SEO, Email Marketing, Design and CRO through its inner partners but can recommend other partners;
-   We implement most of the technical tasks that we create or the other agencies create
